# Nodejs-Read-grid-data-from-csv
This is a simple NodeJs application with Express, which searches for gridata (in a csv file) based upon the input and on finding the data displays the data.
The application uses csv-query for querying csv files.
Winston is used for logging.
Api-Doc is used to document the api. There is a gulp task to document the API.
I have written a tes to test the service. It can be tested by using npm test tests/test.js
